# BDL_Android_App
Android app that uses Yelp API location-based searches to display a list of businesses
The purpose of this app is to display REAL-TIME information about businesses and to allow specific menu-item searches
This app constitutes an MVP to show on a final project presentation.

The menu-item search functionality augments the generic search of Mexican, Asian, Italian, Spanish or any other type of food or drink with very specific dishes, e.g., "arroz negro", "tacos al pastor", "strawberry margarita", "mango smoothie", etc.
For this and the real-time functionality to work we have included in the database, a detailed menu that is updated by the business owner.
This gives the App user a sense of how old the menu is and how often the business updates their menus!
